# Pooreffects Dotfiles
This is the configuration I use for my development laptop (Windows OS). Itâ€™s a combination of borrowed config, settings, and miscellaneous setup stuff that I use all the time.

# Whatâ€™s in here?

- Shortcut aliases to do things that I otherwise have to Google constantly
- Git utilities to make my life easier
- Node utilities
- VS Code settings and aliases to use them
- Custom Windows Powershell Schemes + Starship Layer on top!

Feel free to use any of my settings, happy coding! ðŸ˜ƒ
